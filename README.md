** Banking-Data-Analysis**
Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the bank get a clear picture of its customers, their accounts, and transactions. It provides insights into account balances, customer demographics, and monthly transaction patterns. By identifying inactive accounts, top customers, and balance distributions, the bank can better manage customer relationships and improve financial monitoring.

Steps followed

Step 1 : Created a synthetic dataset using Perplexity with three tables â€“ Customer, Account, and Transaction.

Step 2 : Imported the data into SQL for cleaning and formatting (removed inconsistent data, standardized date columns, fixed invalid account/transaction types).

Step 3 : Combined the three tables using SQL joins to create a reporting view.

Step 4 : Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI.

Step 5 : In Power Query, applied additional cleaning (formatted date fields, removed nulls).

Step 6 : Created DAX measures for total balance, transaction amount, customer counts, age grouping, and inactive accounts.

Step 7 : Built two KPI pages with visuals recommended by Perplexity AI.

Step 8 : Applied formatting and filters to make the dashboard interactive and insightful.
